## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate software developer who loves solving real-world problems through full-stack engineering, deep learning, and elegant design. My experience spans from developing scalable web platforms to building smart IoT-based agriculture solutions and visualizing classic computer science algorithms.

I believe in building projects that not only work but teach. Whether it’s a real-time chat app using WebSockets, a hyperspectral land cover classifier using deep CNNs, or replacing Google Forms with a dynamic React-powered system — I build to learn, and I learn to build better.

## 💼 Featured Projects

### 🏠 **WonderHome** (Airbnb Clone)
> Tech: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, Cloudinary, Passport.js, Joi  
A full-featured property listing platform inspired by Airbnb. Built RESTful CRUD functionality, user authentication, image uploads, and server-side rendering. Booking and calendar integrations are in progress.

### 📋 **Dynamic Form Builder (Internship Project)**
> Tech: React.js, Context API, HTML/CSS  
A fully dynamic admin dashboard to build, preview, and publish Google-Form-style dynamic forms. Improved internal productivity by 30%. Built as a solo internship project.

### 🌾 **Land Cover Classification using CNNs**
> Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit  
Built 1D, 2D, and 3D Convolutional Neural Network pipelines to classify Kansas land covers from hyperspectral images with over 98% accuracy. Also deployed a live dashboard using Streamlit for experimentation.

### 🟢 **Smart Greenhouse System**
> Tech: Python, Flask, IoT Sensors  
A smart micro-climate monitoring and control system that interfaces with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors — enabling automatic and remote greenhouse management.

### 💬 **Real-Time Chat App**
> Tech: Node.js, WebSockets (`ws`), HTML, CSS  
A full-duplex real-time messaging application to simulate peer-to-peer chat using low-level WebSocket protocols.

### 🧠 **Algorithm Visualizations**
> Tech: Java (Swing), OOP  
A suite of interactive visualizations for classic backtracking problems like Rat in a Maze, built from scratch to teach recursive logic with animations.

### 🧾 **Museum Ticketing Portal (SIH Hackathon)**
> Tech: Next.js 13, TypeScript, Mantine, Framer Motion  
A sleek, SSR-first portal for museum booking with animations, calendar-based logic, and user-based routing.

### 🛒 **HOMEFROMHARVEST – Farmer Market App**
> Tech: PHP, MySQL  
A platform that enables farmers to list and sell their fresh produce directly to consumers. Built for smart agriculture deployment.

### 📉 **Tax Minimization Portal**
> Tech: Node.js, Express, JS  
An all-in-one portal with SIP calculator, gratuity planner, and tax estimator for financial planning.
